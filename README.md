# RevolutionaryWomen

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.6.

This project was drawn from the source code & Angular2 tutorial by Ray Villalobos on Lynda.com located here:  https://www.lynda.com/Angular-tutorials/Welcome/572160/580124-4.html?autoplay=true

I wanted to make an Angular2 app that reflected my love of KICK-ASS revolutionary women.
